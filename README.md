# Rose - A Graphics Engine

![image](./images/img_1.png)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide myself with a platform to learn and experiment with different graphics techniques. When I started Rose, my knowledge of computer graphics was limited. I still have plently to learn, but have been able to grow immensely throughout the development of this project. 

## Installation

Rose makes use of Git Submodules, so ensure that you perform a recursive clone...

```
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-URL>
```

To build the project, use CMake...

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to top level CMakeLists.txt>
cmake --build .
```

The graphics API used can be selected through rose/CMakeLists.txt. However, support is limited to OpenGL at this time.

## Features

Some features that Rose supports...

- Physically based rendering
- Clustered deferred rendering
- Skyboxes
- Cascaded shadow maps
- Normal & parallax mapping
- Bloom
- Ambient Occlusion
- HDR

## Roadmap

Some future features and improvements to be made...

- Linux support (there is very little right now that isn't compatible with Linux, just a few small changes need to be made)
- Support for additional graphics APIs
- More robust model loader (currently only supporting GLTF 2.0)
- And plenty of improvements to existing systems...
- Optimization

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
